Red for “No setting applied” and Green for “any setting applied”. Under the “Variables” column, you can see all the Security Response Headers that our extension investigates. On the initial window, in the rightmost column, the “Value” column, you can see if the web page you are on has the respective Security Response Headers set or missing.
